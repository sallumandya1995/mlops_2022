APPLY TO BOTH MODELS (AI21 GPT3)
The dataset name should be exactly similar to SAS Code in all conversions.

PROS of AI21
1. Token issue in gpt3. ai21 has more flexibility.
2. Temperature not an issue in AI21
3. AI21 stopping sequence helps us in getting cleaner code compared to frequency penalty feature of GPT3
4. AI21 api parameters are short and concise. 
5. AI21 - Good customer support.
6. Jurassic-1 model of AI21 is bigger than GPT3 interms of parameters (3 billion more)
7. AI21 - Does not have a waiting list to access the model wherein GPT3 has a waiting list to access it.
8. AI21 Labs offers custom model solutions as a service.

CONS OF AI21
1. The dataset name should be exactly similar to SAS Code in all conversions.

PROS OF GPT3:
1. Better understandability rate than AI21 (set and sort - few cases)


#comments for cohere
1. performance is sub par compared to ai21 and gpt3 (gpt-j is exception as it's still in prelim status)
(the model as per website focused mostly on general language rather than coding languages)
the final conclusion can be reached after  tuning language model and doing comparative analysis
2. website interface is not handy and sloppy at sometimes.
3.Api calls  subscription is expensive than most of the language models.
4. cohere is collabrated with Google cloud and expected to launch their services on GCP platform and could 
be handy for clients looking on on prem language models / solutions.
